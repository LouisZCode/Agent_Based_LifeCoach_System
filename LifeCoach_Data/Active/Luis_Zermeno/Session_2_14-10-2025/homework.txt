PRACTICING PRESENCE: THE PIANO EXPERIMENT

Goal of this Homework

The goal is to reconnect with why you started learning piano in the first place—to experience the joy of creating music—and to notice what happens when you shift from "practicing to be good" to "practicing to enjoy."

Time Needed:

2-3 piano practice sessions before our next meeting (however long feels natural—no pressure on duration)


Before You Begin

Find a moment where you won't be interrupted — somewhere comfortable and familiar.
Take three slow, intentional breaths to arrive in the present moment.
Allow yourself to write honestly, without trying to be correct.
There are no perfect answers — only your truth as it exists right now.
If resistance comes up (this is silly, I don't know how), just notice it with kindness. Resistance is also valuable information.


Instructions:

This week, you're going to practice piano with a completely different intention than before. Instead of practicing to get better or prove something to yourself, you're going to practice to notice what it feels like to simply play. You remember what we talked about—you wanted piano as a creative outlet, something calming, something just for you. This homework invites you back to that original desire.

The shift is subtle but powerful: you're not abandoning your practice or your dedication. You're just changing where your attention goes. Rather than judging whether you're good or bad, you're going to be present with the experience of playing.

How to Do This:

1. Before you sit down to practice, pause for a moment. Remind yourself: "I'm practicing today to enjoy the experience, not to prove anything."

2. As you play, notice without judgment:
   - What does it feel like in your hands?
   - What sounds do you hear?
   - When do you feel engaged or calm?
   - When does frustration come up? (Just notice it—don't fix it.)

3. After each practice session, take 2-3 minutes to jot down quick notes. Nothing formal—just observations:
   - What was the experience like today?
   - Did you notice any moments where you were just present, enjoying the music?
   - When did judgment or frustration show up?
   - What was that like?

4. When you notice yourself slipping back into "I'm not good enough" or "I should be further along"—and you will—just pause and gently remind yourself: "I'm learning. This is how learning feels. It's okay."

5. After your practice, end with a simple affirmation. Something like: "I'm proud of myself for showing up and practicing with kindness today," or whatever feels true to you. Make it personal. Make it something you'd actually say to a friend.

Prompt Questions:

What does it feel like to practice without the pressure of being perfect?
When did you feel most calm or engaged while playing this week?
What moments of frustration came up, and what did you notice about them?
How does it feel different to treat yourself with kindness during your practice, the way you would treat a friend?
What did you learn about yourself through this experiment?

Next Step Planning

As you practice this week, start noticing: What makes practice enjoyable for you? Is it a certain time of day? A certain piece or exercise? A particular feeling? Bring these observations to our next session—they'll help us understand what helps you stay connected to the joy of playing.


Closing

You're doing important work for yourself. Take your time, be gentle with your process, and let whatever comes up be enough.
