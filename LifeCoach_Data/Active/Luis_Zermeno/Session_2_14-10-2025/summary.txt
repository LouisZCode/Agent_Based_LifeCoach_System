From Perfectionism to Self-Compassion

Hi Luis,

Today's session was powerful and revealing. You arrived wanting to talk about piano frustration, but through our conversation, you uncovered something much deeper — a perfectionist pattern that has been running your life across work, learning, and even how you treat yourself. Your willingness to follow that thread, to sit with the discomfort of seeing this pattern clearly, and to stay open to a different way of being — that took real courage and self-awareness.

Main Takeaways

Unrealistic Timelines & Comparison: You came in believing three weeks of piano practice should have gotten you further than "basic scales." We talked about how three weeks is incredibly short when learning an instrument — most people take months just to get comfortable with the basics. The comparison trap (watching 8-year-olds play Chopin on YouTube) was amplifying your frustration and stealing your joy. What shifted: You're now able to see your daily practice as genuinely impressive for someone just starting out, rather than evidence of failure.

The Physical vs. Intellectual Learning Curve: A huge insight emerged when we explored the difference between learning software (your strength at work, where things "click fast") and learning piano (which requires muscle memory and physical coordination over time). You realized your body needs time to develop the skill that your brain intellectually understands. This reframing took some of the pressure off immediately — it's not that you're "not musical" or "too old at 32," it's that you're learning something that requires patience and repetition.

The Deeper Pattern: Perfectionism Tied to Self-Worth: Through our conversation, you traced this back to school and your parents' happiness being tied to your performance. You learned early that "your worth was tied to your performance" — and now, even when you're doing something just for fun, like learning piano, you automatically load it with pressure to be good at it. You can't just enjoy something; it "has to mean something." This pattern shows up at work too. The weight of this realization was real, but so was your recognition: "that seems kind of unfair when i think about it."

From "Practicing to Get Better" to "Practicing to Enjoy": The shift we landed on is simple but profound. Instead of practicing piano to prove you're good enough, you're going to practice to experience the joy and calmness you originally wanted — the creative outlet for yourself. Here's what's interesting: when you stop trying so hard to be perfect, you actually learn faster and more naturally. Your body relaxes, and learning happens more organically. This isn't just about piano; it's about how you approach everything.

Self-Compassion as a Practice Tool: We talked about treating yourself the way you'd treat a friend who was learning piano and struggling. You immediately knew what to say to a friend: "Hey, it's okay. You're just starting out. Give yourself time. It's supposed to be fun." But turning that kindness inward feels different — because there's a voice saying "I should know better" and "I should be able to handle this." What emerged: self-compassion isn't weakness; it's fairness. And it's a practice, just like piano. Every time you notice yourself being harsh, you can pause and choose differently.

Tools

Expectation Reframing: Examining whether your timeline expectations match reality, and recognizing that learning curves are longer than we often believe.

Comparative Awareness: Noticing the comparison trap and how it steals joy. Shifting from "I'm not as good as those kids on YouTube" to "I'm doing great for where I am."

Physical vs. Intellectual Learning: Understanding that different types of learning require different timelines and different kinds of patience.

Pattern Recognition: Tracing your perfectionist pattern back to its roots (parental conditioning, tying worth to performance) so you can see it clearly and make conscious choices.

Self-Compassion Practice: Treating yourself with the same kindness and patience you'd extend to a friend, especially when learning something new or making mistakes.

Most Recent Achievements!

You recognized a pattern that's been running your life and had the courage to explore where it came from — that's significant self-awareness.

You shifted your perspective on mistakes from "proof that I'm not good enough" to "neutral information that shows me what to practice." That's a fundamental reframe.

You connected your surface frustration (piano) to a deeper belief system (worth tied to performance), and you stayed with that conversation even though it was uncomfortable.

You're willing to try a completely different approach — practicing for enjoyment rather than perfection — even though it feels "a little scary."

You recognized the unfairness of holding yourself to standards you'd never hold anyone else to, and you're open to practicing self-compassion as an alternative.

These insights show real honesty and openness — they demonstrate your genuine commitment to understanding yourself and changing patterns that aren't serving you.

Next Steps

Practice piano this week with a new intention: focus on how it feels to play, not on how well you play. Be present with the music without judging yourself.

Practice self-compassion throughout the week — not just with piano, but in all areas of your life. When you notice yourself being harsh, pause and choose kindness instead.

Notice when the perfectionist voice shows up (telling you that you "should be better" or "should know better"), and have a sense of humor about it rather than taking it seriously.

Let's check in next week and see how the experiment goes. I'm excited to hear what shifts when you take the pressure off.

You came in stressed about piano. You're leaving with clarity about a much bigger pattern and a real willingness to approach it differently. That's the work of a meaningful session. See you next week, Luis.
