Session Prep: Luis Zermeno - Session 3

1. GREETING / CHECK-IN

Start with your usual grounding questions:
- How has your week been? How are you doing today?
- Notice his energy level and emotional tone compared to last session

SPECIFIC CONTEXT TO NOTICE:
Luis came in stressed about piano and discovered a deeper perfectionism pattern. Watch for:
- Has his energy shifted around piano practice? Is he more relaxed or still frustrated?
- Notice if he's being harder or softer on himself this week
- Pay attention to his tone when he talks about the homework - is there joy, frustration, or curiosity?
- Watch for signs that the self-compassion concept is landing or if he's still struggling with it

2. GUIDED CHECK-IN (3 DEEP BREATHS)

Guide Luis through 3 slow, intentional breaths
Record: What emotion surfaces for him right now?
Record: Where is he holding tension in his body?
Record: What natural topic or feeling emerges?

3. HOMEWORK ASSESSMENT

HOMEWORK ASSIGNED: Piano practice experiment (2-3 times before next session)
Focus: Practicing with the intention to enjoy the process rather than perfect it. Observing and taking notes without judgment. Using an affirmation after practice.

KEY QUESTIONS TO ASK:
- How many times did you practice piano this week?
- What did you notice when you focused on enjoying it rather than improving?
- Did you write any notes? What surprised you?
- What moments felt different from your usual practice sessions?
- Did the affirmation help shift your mindset? What did it feel like?

If he didn't complete it: Explore gently - Was it time? Did the pressure creep back in? Did the idea feel uncomfortable? Did perfectionism stop him from "doing it right"?

If he completed it: Celebrate specifically what he noticed and how it felt different.

4. MAIN FOCUS OF THE SESSION

OPENING PHASE (Light Check-In):
- Celebrate any progress with piano homework
- Notice shifts in his emotional experience around practice
- Build on the momentum from last session's breakthroughs

TRANSITIONAL PHASE (Deepening):
- Explore the piano experience more deeply: What made it enjoyable when it was? What pulled him back into frustration?
- Notice patterns: Did he slip back into perfectionism? When and why?

MAIN EXPLORATION (Self-Compassion Tools):
- Introduce PRACTICAL TOOLS for self-compassion that Luis can use when perfectionism shows up
- Move from awareness ("I see my pattern") to action ("Here's what I can do about it")

Suggested progression:
1. Acknowledge that knowing about perfectionism is step one
2. Introduce the "Friend Test" in action - show him how to USE it, not just understand it
3. Build toward exploring the parent connection more deeply
4. Help him see how self-compassion is the antidote to perfectionism

4.1 CONCEPTS TO CLARIFY / DEEPEN

- Self-compassion vs. self-indulgence: Luis may believe self-compassion means giving up on growth. Clarify this distinction.
- Perfectionism as a protection mechanism: His perfectionism likely started as a way to earn love/approval. Understanding this can soften the pattern.
- The connection between enjoyment and learning: Revisit how relaxation actually improves performance (he understood this intellectually last session)

4.2 SUGGESTED TOOLS & EXERCISES

PRACTICAL SELF-COMPASSION TOOLS:
1. **The Friend Script** - Have Luis practice saying his critical thoughts out loud as if to a friend, then reframe them with compassion. Make it tangible and usable.

2. **The Pause & Redirect** - When perfectionism shows up (during piano or work), teach Luis a simple pause technique:
   - Notice the critical thought
   - Ask: "Is this helping me or hurting me?"
   - Choose a kinder version
   
3. **The Affirmation Anchor** - Build on the homework affirmation. What affirmations resonate with him? What would his younger self need to hear?

4. **Values Check-In** - Help him reconnect with WHY he wanted piano (creative outlet, calmness). When perfectionism creeps in, anchor back to his values, not his performance.

POTENTIAL PARENT EXPLORATION:
When you sense he's ready (likely mid-to-late session), gently explore:
- "You mentioned your parents were disappointed when you didn't do well. What did you learn about yourself from that?"
- "What would it mean if you failed at piano, or failed at work?"
- "What did you need from your parents back then that you're now trying to give yourself through perfectionism?"

This sets up for deeper exploration in future sessions, but don't force it - follow his readiness.

5. EMERGING TOPICS / CLIENT-LED EXPLORATION

Topics that may surface or that you should be ready for:
- **Work perfectionism**: He mentioned this affects work too. Be ready if he wants to explore how perfectionism shows up at his job
- **Deeper parent wounds**: He may want to understand more about the parental conditioning. Be ready to go there if he brings it up
- **Fear of failure**: Underneath perfectionism is often a fear of failure. This may emerge as you explore further
- **Identity and worth**: His worth being tied to performance is core. This may come up naturally as you explore the parent connection

6. WRAP-UP & INTEGRATION

REMIND HIM:
- The major insight from last session: His perfectionism pattern started as a survival strategy to earn approval
- The shift: From "I must be perfect to be worthy" → "I am worthy, and I can enjoy learning"
- His courage: He was vulnerable enough to see the deeper pattern and willing to experiment with a new approach

REINFORCE:
- Practicing piano for enjoyment IS making progress (progress toward his actual goal - a creative outlet)
- Self-compassion is not weakness; it's the tool that allows him to learn and grow
- This week was an experiment. No judgment. Just observation and curiosity.

7. NEXT STEPS

PATHWAY FORWARD:
- Continue building self-compassion as a practical skill (not just a concept)
- Move toward understanding the parental roots of perfectionism (if he's ready)
- Explore how these patterns show up in his work life
- Begin shifting from "I must be perfect" to "I'm learning, and that's the point"

ANTICIPATED PROGRESSION:
Session 3: Practical self-compassion tools + light parent exploration
Session 4+: Deeper parent/family pattern work + reframing his identity beyond performance

8. HOMEWORK FOR NEXT SESSION

(To be determined based on how this session unfolds, but potential direction:)
- Continue piano practice with enjoyment focus (building the habit)
- Practice self-compassion tool(s) when perfectionism shows up (both with piano and work)
- Observation: Notice when perfectionism shows up. What triggered it? How did you respond?
- Optional: Journaling about what self-compassion felt like when he used it

9. FINAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT

Specific progress to recognize next session:
- His willingness to question his perfectionism pattern (most people avoid this)
- His honesty about how deeply this runs (not just piano, but work and self-treatment)
- His openness to experimenting with a new way, even when it felt scary
- His commitment to self-awareness and growth

Acknowledge next time: "You showed real courage last week in seeing this pattern and being willing to try something different. That's the kind of awareness that changes things."
